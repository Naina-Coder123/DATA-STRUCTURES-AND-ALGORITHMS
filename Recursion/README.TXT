This structure is applied to many upcoming problems 
very very important



for printing the all subsequences:
    parameter wise


for printing 1 subsequence or any one subsequence:
    return true and false and avoid recursion calls if you get true


for count :
     return 0 
     return 1
     and add all f()
     for two recursion calls add l=f()+r=f()  
     for n recursion calls add n f()
